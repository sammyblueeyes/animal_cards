Animal Card Reader Hacks
============

The repository includes:
* a Qt program to generate some extra Woolworths animal cards to see if there are any easter eggs in the Animal card sound reader gadget.
* arduino code to brute force trigger the animal card reader to play each sound (without having to print any generated cards)

The project is explained here:

I'll probably revisit it periodically as I aquire new skills and equipment for analysing/hacking the hardware.
